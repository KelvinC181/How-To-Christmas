# How to Christmas

"How to Christmas" is a static website that seeks to provide guidance on how to make the most of the festive season. More specifically, it offers recipes, movie suggestions, and gift ideas.

## The Design, Development, and Deployment Process

### First Team Meeting

Our hackathon team had a Slack huddle to discuss the project. We agreed on an idea, added user stories to [a kanban board](https://github.com/users/KelvinC181/projects/9), and considered that we might draw upon the Bootstrap framework for some aspects. We each created a Gitpod workspace from our shared GitHub repository.

### Recipe Page

#### Basic Recipe Page

[Niall](https://github.com/niall-code) drafted a simple recipes page overnight.

#### Styling of Recipe Page

[Noah](https://github.com/Noah-Samawi) and [Niall](https://github.com/niall-code) significantly improved the styling of the initial recipe page, by introducing Bootstrap card components around each recipe and by using flexbox to move the ingredients lists from below to alongside the images on large devices.
